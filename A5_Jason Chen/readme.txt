Assignment 5

A5_Q1
This program prints the result of breadth first search of adjacency matrix.
Create an adjacency matrix starting with vertex 0 (if you want to start with vertex 1, you have to change the "System.out.print(e + " ")" to "System.out.print(e+1 + " ")" in A5_Q1. 
Basically, add 1 to e if want to start with vertex 1. 
Then create an A5_Q1 object. 
Call the BFS method in A5_Q1 with the matrix you created and a starting vertex as arguments.

MyGraph
This is a graph and Dijkstra and Prim program.
Create a MyGraph object.
Add the edges.
Call the dijkstra method.
Calle the prim method.
